    <h1>Privacy Policy – Cansino</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 16, 2025<br />
      <strong>Developer:</strong> .zipcave (nino.zip94)<br />

    </p>

    <p>
      Cansino (“the App”, “we”, “our”) is a productivity app that helps reduce procrastination using
      tasks, challenges, and a token-based wallet. The app is offered as a freemium service and intended for use “as is”.
      Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what we collect, why, and how we handle it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The app does <strong>not request personally identifiable information</strong> such as your name,
      email address, or precise location. Cansino is primarily <strong>local-first</strong>; your tasks,
      challenges, and wallet balances live on your device. However, the following data may be processed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymous purchase metadata</strong> via RevenueCat (e.g., product identifiers, country/region,
          transaction status & expiration).</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising identifiers or device-level signals</strong> via Google AdMob
          (personalized or non-personalized ads depending on your consent).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent choices</strong> for privacy regulations via Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP).</li>
      <li><strong>Technical information</strong> (e.g., OS version, device model, crash/diagnostic info provided by platform SDKs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
    <p>The app integrates the following services, which process data under their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – shows ads in the free tier; serves personalized or non-personalized ads based on your consent.<br/>
        Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Google UMP (User Messaging Platform)</strong> – collects and stores your consent choices for GDPR/US state regulations.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – manages in-app purchases and entitlements (e.g., token packs).<br/>
        Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revenuecat.com/privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> – processes purchases through the App Store.<br/>
        Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple.com/legal/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Apple App Store Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      This privacy policy is intended to comply with App Store guidelines. The data collected by <strong>El Cansino</strong> is used solely to improve user experience and app functionality. We do not share any user data with third parties for tracking purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple may collect additional data as described in their own <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>, including analytics and crash diagnostics. We do not access, store, or control that data.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>About tokens & wallet:</strong> Tokens are a virtual balance used for challenges and optional ad-free periods.
      Tokens are <em>not money</em>, non-redeemable for cash, and managed locally in the app. Purchases are processed by Apple/RevenueCat;
      we never see your card details.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Ads, Consent & Personalization</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In regions like the EEA/UK/CH, we use <strong>Google UMP</strong> to request consent for ads. You may choose
          <em>personalized</em> or <em>non-personalized</em> ads, or opt out where applicable.</li>
      <li>If you do not consent, the app will still show <strong>non-personalized (contextual) ads</strong>.</li>
      <li>Cansino may offer an <strong>ad-free period</strong> (e.g., via tokens). During that time, the app suppresses ad requests.</li>
      <li><em>ATT (App Tracking Transparency)</em>: if in the future we request Apple’s tracking permission (IDFA),
          you will see the iOS system prompt. Granting or denying it is up to you; the app works either way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your tasks, challenges, and wallet data are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using on-device storage.</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not run our own servers</strong> for your content. Third-party SDKs (AdMob/RevenueCat/Apple) may retain limited
          metadata necessary to provide their services, under their respective policies.</li>
      <li>You may delete local app data by uninstalling the app. Purchases remain restorable through Apple.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>
      The app is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
      If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent management:</strong> In supported regions, Google’s consent message lets you choose personalized vs.
          non-personalized ads. You can revisit your choices when the message is shown again or by re-installing the app if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>EEA/UK/CH users:</strong> You may have rights under GDPR (access, rectification, deletion, objection, restriction).
          To exercise them regarding third-party SDK data, see their policies linked above. For app-local data, uninstalling removes it.</li>
      <li>For requests or questions, email us at <a href="mailto:nino.zip94@gmail.com">nino.zip94@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use platform-provided SDKs (Apple/Google) and store user content locally. While no method is 100% secure,
      we aim to collect the minimum necessary data and rely on trusted providers for purchases and ads.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will appear on this page and take effect immediately upon posting.
