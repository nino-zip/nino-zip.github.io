    <h1>Terms and Conditions – Cansino</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-08-16</p>

    <p>
      These terms and conditions apply to the Cansino app (the “Application”)
      for mobile devices created by <strong>.zipcave (nino.zip94)</strong> (“Service Provider”),
      offered as a <strong>freemium</strong> service. By downloading or using the Application,
      you agree to be bound by these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Please read these terms carefully. Unauthorized copying, reverse engineering,
      extraction of source code, or creation of derivative works is prohibited.
      All intellectual property rights in the Application remain with the Service Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>2. In-App Purchases & Tokens</h2>
    <p>
      Cansino offers optional in-app purchases (processed by Apple via StoreKit and
      managed by RevenueCat) for <strong>token packs</strong>. Tokens are a virtual item used
      inside the app (e.g., to create challenges, temporarily pause ads, or receive
      small rewards).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No cash value:</strong> Tokens are <em>not</em> real money, have no monetary value,
          are non-redeemable for cash, non-refundable, non-transferable, and can only be used within Cansino.</li>
      <li><strong>All sales final:</strong> Purchases are final except where required by Apple’s refund policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Wallet & holds:</strong> When you start a challenge, tokens may be <em>placed on hold</em>
          until the challenge is completed or fails. If you win, the hold is released and a
          small bonus may be granted; if you lose/cancel, the held tokens may be deducted.</li>
      <li><strong>Fair use:</strong> You agree not to manipulate the token system (e.g., automated actions,
          fake engagement, device spoofing, ad fraud). We may reverse balances or restrict access in case of abuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Economy changes:</strong> We may adjust token prices, rewards, or challenge rules prospectively.
          We will not reduce previously purchased token balances but may change how future tokens are earned or used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ads & Ad-Free Periods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The free tier may display ads via <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. In applicable regions,
          <strong>Google UMP (User Messaging Platform)</strong> is used to collect consent for ad personalization.</li>
      <li>If you do not consent, the app will show <strong>non-personalized (contextual) ads</strong>.</li>
      <li>You may use tokens to activate a <strong>temporary ad-free period</strong>. During that time,
          the app suppresses ad requests. When the period ends, ads resume unless you activate another ad-free period.</li>
      <li><em>ATT (IDFA)</em>: If we request Apple’s App Tracking Transparency permission in the future,
          you will see the iOS prompt. The app functions even if you decline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Challenges (Motivational, not Gambling)</h2>
    <p>
      Challenges are goal-oriented tasks designed to help reduce procrastination. Outcomes depend solely on your
      task completion—not on chance. Cansino does <strong>not</strong> offer real-money prizes or wagering.
      Tokens used in challenges are a <em>game mechanic</em> to encourage consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Usage & Restrictions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You agree not to misuse the Application or interfere with its normal operation.</li>
      <li>Do not jailbreak/root your device; doing so may compromise security or break functionality.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to circumvent ads, tamper with the wallet, exploit bugs, or use automation/bots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Connectivity & Liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service Provider is not responsible for malfunctions due to lack of internet,
          device issues, or unsupported OS versions.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for any carrier/network charges incurred while using the Application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Updates & Termination</h2>
    <p>
      The Application may be updated to maintain compatibility or enhance functionality.
      Updates may be required to continue using certain features. We may discontinue or
      suspend the Application (or specific features) at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Application is primarily <strong>local-first</strong>; your tasks, challenges, and wallet data
      are stored on your device. We use third-party SDKs for ads (AdMob/UMP) and purchases (StoreKit/RevenueCat).
      For details, see our <a href="privacy-policy-cansino.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cansino is a productivity tool; results may vary. We do not guarantee specific outcomes.</li>
      <li>Cansino is not financial advice, mental-health treatment, or gambling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Age</h2>
    <p>
      The Application is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately.
      Continued use of the Application implies acceptance of the updated terms.
