## ðŸ§  About me

I'm a solo indie iOS dev working after hours, turning random ideas into real apps. I build tools that solve my problems, and hopefully yours too.

I discovered **Swift** a while ago, fell in love with it, and now I spend my nights designing and coding for fun.

With **5+ years of experience in tech**, I care deeply about **UI, UX, and all the little visual details** that make an app feel good.

This is my playground, so bear with me if something breaks (it probably will ðŸ˜…). Iâ€™m going to be panic-googling but I'll fix it, promise.
